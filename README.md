This project is a **Point of Sale (POS) system** developed as part of the **IV1350 Object-Oriented Design** course. The system simulates item transactions, tracks total revenue, and logs errors such as missing inventory items. It ensures smooth transaction processing while maintaining a detailed log of activities and revenue.

The image shows a typical console output during a transaction process, including item registration, receipt generation, error logs, and revenue updates.

The project follows an **object-oriented design** approach:  
- The `src` package contains all program code, implementing the core functionalities of the system.  
- The `test` package includes dedicated test classes for verifying the behavior of each class in the system.
